# Template for Event Sessions

## Abstract

_How to write up an Event Session on DARIAH-Campus_

This session will demonstrate the features and sections that can be used to
capture details from any training events. You can use the .mdx of this page as a
template and fill in the various fields to best match your event. Simply replace
the metadata fields with the information about your event, and replace any white
text, such as this, with your own. For example, you might want to use this
section to give an overview of the event, why it was coordinated, who
coordinated it, and what it covered.

You can also provide additional documentation from your event as downlodable
items, such as a pdf, like the one below. You can also include links to external
sites, if you have an event website or blog that has collected all the
information from your event.

<Speaker speaker="vicky-garnett">

[Vicky Garnett] is just an example here, but you can use this space to provide a
biography of your speaker. This can be generated automatically from the metadata
associated with your speaker from the person.yaml file, or you can over-write
that information and provide it here if you want to have a slightly different
biography that is more tailored to this event. You can add as many speaker
profiles as you like here.

[Speaker 2]This is just another example of how multiple speakers may be
presented on this template.
