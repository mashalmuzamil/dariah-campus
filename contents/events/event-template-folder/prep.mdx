# How to prepare

_replace this text with your own!_ This is where you will tell your event
participants how they can prepare (if required) for the event, IF you are
publishing this before the event takes place.

There is no need to use this file if you are posting the outputs of an event
AFTER it has taken place. IF you don't require it, you can delete it from your
event folder.
